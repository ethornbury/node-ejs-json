# node-exmple

This was done in a [Cloud9](https://c9.io/login) Node workspace

To set up the environment
    
    $npm install
    
    mkdir myapp
	
	$ cd myapp
	
	$ npm init //set the entry point: (index.js) change to app.js

	$ npm install --save express
	
	$ npm install ejs
	
	$ npm install body-parser
	
	$ npm install node.date-time //so I can use a timestamp in the log file
	
	$ npm install formidable //file uploader
	
	$npm install mysql
    
    
I set a free mysql database in [Gearhost](http://gearhost.com) and the project links to it.

Use Workbench, set up a new connection with the details from Gearhost and view database locally.
